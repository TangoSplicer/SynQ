🧪 **Tests Export + Sign + Package**

```synq
test release_automation:

    uses compiler.export.exporter as exporter
    uses signing.signer as signer
    uses io.fs as fs

    case "export and sign plugin":
        let base = "examples/plugins/teleport/"
        let main = base + "main.synq"
        exporter.export_plugin(main, "bin")
        signer.sign_plugin(replace_ext(main, ".bin"))
        assert fs.exists(base + "main.bin.sig")

    case "validate bundle output":
        let meta = fs.read_json("examples/plugins/teleport/release_meta.json")
        assert meta["signed"]
        assert meta["score"] > 50
