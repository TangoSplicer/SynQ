## Overview

**SynQHUB** is SynQ’s official cloud-connected platform for publishing, orchestrating, and collaborating on:

- Plugins
- Projects
- Hybrid quantum-classical-AI jobs
- Team deployments

SynQHUB bridges local plugin development with scalable distributed execution environments.

---

## 1. What is SynQHUB?

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| 🔌 Plugin Registry | Discover, version, and publish plugins |
| ⚙️ Hybrid Job Runtime | Submit and monitor classical + quantum jobs |
| 🧠 AI & Model Execution | Dispatch LLM-driven or quantum-augmented jobs |
| 📊 Monitoring Tools | Live execution timelines and profiling |
| 👥 Collaboration | Team roles, channels, and shared environments |

---

## 2. Authentication & Configuration

Configure your access:

```bash
synq config --key <YOUR_API_KEY>

Or edit your .synqrc:

{
  "hub_token": "your_token_here",
  "hub_url": "https://hub.synq.dev"
}


---

3. Plugin Publishing

To publish a plugin to SynQHUB:

synq publish --remote qchem_opt quantlab

Also available in code:

from src.plugin.registry import remote_hub
remote_hub.publish_plugin_to_synqhub("qchem_opt", team="quantlab")

Plugin bundles include:

plugin.json

Source files

Docs, metadata, tags



---

4. Plugin Store Access

Search and install plugins:

synqhub search visual
synqhub install qpu_visualizer

Or browse: https://hub.synq.dev/plugins


---

5. Hybrid Job Deployment

Submit jobs from CLI:

synqhub deploy --input teleportation.synq --target aws

Target types:

local (test/debug)

aws, azure, gcp (cloud QPU)

llm (AI-only)

cluster (full hybrid jobs)



---

6. Job Monitoring

Monitor jobs in real-time:

synqhub monitor

Features:

⏱ Gate execution timelines

📉 Memory and performance

🔬 Quantum state evolution

💰 Cost estimation and runtime analytics



---

7. Collaboration & Teams

Teams can:

Share environments

Define roles + access control

Use public/private plugin scopes

Trigger webhooks (CI/CD)



---

8. Plugin Validation & Trust Scoring

SynQHUB validates plugins using:

✅ Safety (sandbox compliance)

🚀 Performance (telemetry data)

🔥 Popularity (usage stats)

🧩 Compatibility (compiler, REPL)


Tag statuses:

trusted

experimental

deprecated



---

9. Automation with CLI

Batch example:

synqhub run-batch joblist.yaml

Scheduled jobs:

synqhub schedule --cron "0 */4 * * *" --job optimize.synq


---

10. Advanced Developer Functions

Command	Description

synq pull <plugin>	Pull from SynQHUB
synq sync-meta	Sync metadata registry
synq verify <plugin>	Verify plugin signature



---

11. File + Code Overview

File	Purpose

remote_hub.py	Remote interaction logic
synq_publish.cpp	CLI wrapper for upload/pull/verify
synqhub_metadata.json	Local metadata cache
54_synqhub_demo.ipynb	Jupyter demonstration



---

📓 Demo Notebook

Open:

notebooks/54_synqhub_demo.ipynb

Features publishing, pulling, syncing, and signature validation.


---

🧪 Signature Verification

Every plugin is:

SHA256-fingerprinted

Verified against hub manifest

Quorum-signed via distributed keyring



---

🛠 Troubleshooting

Problem	Fix

API key rejected	Refresh .synqrc token
Plugin not visible	Confirm publish + visibility
Job not deployed	Check synq validate and logs
