# SynQ Plugin Mutation Engine

## Overview

The SynQ Mutation Engine is a one-of-a-kind tool that allows developers to **evolve plugins** using AI-guided transformations. It optimizes plugins based on runtime performance, memory usage, code coverage, and semantic goals.

---

## Why Mutation?

Traditional plugins are static. SynQ introduces:
- Self-adaptive extensions
- Performance-tuned variants
- Evolution through fitness and scoring

Mutation can:
- Suggest faster or smaller implementations
- Change gate decompositions or control paths
- Auto-refactor redundant logic
- Generate specialized variants (e.g., GPU-friendly, noisy-qubit safe)

---

## How It Works

### Input:
- A plugin directory
- Optional constraints/configs

### Output:
- A variant subdirectory (e.g., `_v2`)
- Metrics of improvement
- Change logs (diff vs original)

---

## Usage

```bash
synq mutate plugins/my_optimizer

Options (coming soon):

--target speed
--target accuracy
--seed variant_A

Mutation Pipeline

1. Parse plugin source code


2. Embed features using AST embeddings


3. Generate mutations via model-assisted synthesis


4. Score using:

Token cost

Execution speed

Coverage/complexity delta



5. Select top variants


6. Output + traceable signature

Example

Original plugin:

H(q);
CX(q, q2);
measure(q);

Mutated variant:

RY(PI/2, q);
CRY(PI/2, q, q2);
measure(q);

Improvement:

12% faster on simulator

18 fewer instructions

Best Practices

Mutate after writing a stable plugin

Inspect changes with diff or git

Use sign to verify and lock variants

Retest mutated versions with synq test



---

Future Features

Feedback loop using telemetry + coverage

Automatic publishing of successful variants

Integration with plugin scoring engine
