# SynQ Future Roadmap & Vision

## Overview

SynQ is evolving as a cutting-edge platform to unify quantum computation, classical logic, and intelligent AI-assisted programming. This document outlines upcoming directions for the language, compiler, runtime, ecosystem, and developer experience.

---

## 1. Language Roadmap

### Short-Term Goals
- Lambda expressions for quantum-classical-AI blocks
- Pattern matching over quantum + classical states
- Probabilistic types and hybrid conditionals

### Mid-Term Goals
- Tensor-style quantum syntax
- Gradient-based quantum learning
- Type-safe quantum teleportation models

### Long-Term
- Dependent types for quantum register sizing
- Auto-verification of teleportation/inversion circuits

---

## 2. Compiler Enhancements

- Self-optimizing pass manager
- IR-guided plugin scoring engine
- On-the-fly plugin mutation with `synq mutate` ✅
- Adaptive IR tracing with `synq qtrace` ✅
- Fuzzing AI layers with `synq fuzz` ✅

---

## 3. Runtime + AI Integrations

- Embedding models directly into circuit evolution
- Visual memory-mapped AI circuits
- LLM output scoring to influence circuit collapse
- Runtime token econometrics + `synq profile` scoring

---

## 4. REPL & Live Coding

- Live-coding quantum operators
- AI feedback injected into REPL flows
- Circuit auto-commenting
- Persistent prompt learning (prompt tokens stored + mutated)

---

## 5. CLI Extensions (Achieved)

The following innovations have already landed:
- Plugin Mutation (`synq mutate`) ✅
- Prompt Fuzzing (`synq fuzz`) ✅
- Visual Tracing (`synq qtrace`) ✅
- Chain Execution (`synq chain`) ✅
- Secure Signing (`synq sign`) ✅
- Heatmap + Tutor (`synq skillmap`) ✅

---

## 6. SynQHub Evolution

- Mesh-based plugin registry
- Plugin marketplace with trust ratings
- AI-assisted plugin linting & scoring
- Secure federated deployment network

---

## 7. Education + Community

- `SynQ Playground`: web-based visual live REPL
- `SynQ EduKit`: simplified syntax for students
- `SynQ HackSuite`: mutation and plugin challenge packs

---

## Final Thoughts

SynQ is no longer just a programming language — it is a **computational design space**. With true AI-circuit synergy, extensible compiler layers, and a CLI that rewrites the developer experience, SynQ aims to exceed everything that came before.
