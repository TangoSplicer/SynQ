# SynQ Plugin Guide

---

## Overview

SynQ’s plugin system enables developers to extend the compiler and runtime with powerful new functionality:

- 🧱 Custom quantum gates, optimization passes, visual renderers
- 🤖 AI-augmented plugins for tuning, validation, mutation
- 🔄 Transpilation targets and hybrid simulation extensions
- 🧠 Code intelligence and compiler internal diagnostics

Plugins are isolated, composable, and shareable via SynQHub. They integrate with SynQ’s REPL, CLI, and notebook interface seamlessly.

## Plugin Structure

my_plugin/ ├── plugin.json ├── src/ │   └── my_plugin.cpp ├── include/ │   └── my_plugin.h ├── tests/ ├── README.md

---

## Plugin Lifecycle

### 1. Create a Plugin

```bash
synq create plugin my_plugin

2. Build the Plugin

synq plugin build my_plugin

3. Validate Functionality

synq plugin validate my_plugin

4. Publish to Registry

synq plugin publish my_plugin

5. Sign for Distribution

synq sign my_plugin/plugin.json


---

Advanced Plugin Tools


---

🔬 Inspect Plugin Internals

synq inspect my_plugin

File count

Memory/footprint stats

Registry + tag info



---

🧬 Mutate Plugin Variants (AI-Assisted)

synq mutate my_plugin

AI suggests new plugin variants

Generates _v2, _v3 versions with:

Reduced gate count

Lower token usage

Higher fidelity or interpretability




---

🧪 Fuzz for Safety (AI Plugin Only)

synq fuzz my_plugin

Detects:

Prompt injection vectors

Token explosion triggers

Model inconsistency




---

Plugin Metadata Example (plugin.json)

{
  "name": "visual_debugger",
  "version": "1.0.1",
  "entry": "src/visual_debugger.cpp",
  "sandbox": true,
  "tags": ["visual", "debug"],
  "engine": ">=1.0.0"
}


---

🔐 Plugin Signing

All published plugins must be signed for verification:

synq sign --sign path/to/plugin.json dev1

To verify later:

synq sign --verify path/to/plugin.json dev1

.sig file is auto-generated beside plugin

Uses QRYPTA-TGIL quantum-safe lattice signature scheme

Required for "Trusted" status on SynQHub



---

🔄 Plugin Distribution

synq plugin publish my_plugin

Uploads to SynQHub

Supports public, private, and team-scoped publishing

All metadata and version pins included



---

🧠 Tips for Plugin Authors

🔹 Modular = Maintainable → 1 class per function

🔹 Use synq inspect before publishing

🔹 Always sign before releasing

🔹 Use mutate to evolve plugin post-launch

🔹 Add sandbox: true to isolate unsafe plugins
