// --- SynQ AI Module Demonstration ---

// Define a prompt and a model
prompt = "Explain the concept of quantum teleportation in simple terms."

// Execute model inference
answer = run GPT4(prompt)

// Print result
print("AI Response:")

// --- Hybrid Example with Quantum Serialization ---

// Build a simple quantum circuit
allocate(q0)
allocate(q1)
entangle(q0, q1)

// Get serialized description
circuit_desc = serialize_circuit()

// Use AI to explain the circuit
explanation = run GPT4("What does this circuit do?\n" + circuit_desc)

print("Circuit Explanation:")
