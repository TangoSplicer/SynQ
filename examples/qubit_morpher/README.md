# Qubit Morpher Plugin

Adapts gates to the physical or logical quantum hardware topology.

## Features

- Uses dynamic geometry to adjust U3 gate parameters
- Switches between CNOT and SWAP depending on connectivity

## Use Case

Works well on quantum hardware with non-ideal connectivity, applying runtime morphing.
